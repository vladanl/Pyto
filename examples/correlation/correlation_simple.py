"""

Establishes a correlation between two arbitrary systems and correlates 
positions of objects of interest between these two systems. 

The corelation procedure used in this script is direct, meaning there are no 
intermediary systems. Also, both systems have to have the same dimensionality.

Conceptually, the correlation procedure consists of two steps:
  1) Establish a correlation between the two systems (initial and final), 
that is find a coordinate transformation between the two systems.
  2) Correlate positions of obects of interest (targets) from one system to 
the other.

Prerequisite: Marker points are needed to determine the transformation 
(steps 1). That is, one needs to identify one set of features that are 
visible in both systems.

This is a very simple script where coordinates of markers and targets are 
entered directly. The calculated transformation parameters and the coordinates 
of the correlated target points are displayed on the standard output. 

Standard usage:

1) Edit this file to enter the desired parameters (coordinates of markers 
and objects of interest, and the transformation type)
2) Import and run this file (from IPython or similar):
  >>> import correlation_simple
  >>> correlation_simple.main()

Advanced usage:

1) As in the standard usage.
2) Import this file and execute commands from main() one by one
  >>> import correlation_simple
  >>> from correlation_simple import *
  >>> corr = Basic()
  >>> corr.establish(
        markers_1=markers_initial, markers_2=markers_final, 
        type_=transform_type)
  >>> corr.transf_1_to_2.phiDeg
  >>> corr.transf_1_to_2.gl
      ...
Other attributes of corr are listed in the documentation for 
pyto.correlative.Basic. If the initial and final systems are 2D, object 
corr.transf_1_to_2 is an instance of pyto.geometry.Affine2D, if they are 3D
corr.transf_1_to_2 is an instance of pyto.geometry.AffinewD and in other cases
of pyto.geometry.Affine. Please check docs for these classes for other 
attributes.

        Reads data for each observation (experiment) separately, extracts 
        specified properties and yields the results.

        An observation is defined by a category and an identifier (formed
        by all combinations of values specified by category and identifier 
        arguments) and is associated with a file, according to self.files.  

        For each observation, this generator yelds the corresponding object,
        as well as an ..analysis.Observations object that contains the 
        properties of all observations read up to that point. Note that 
        after each iteration an updated version od the same object is 
        yielded (the object id staus the same). The intention is that 
        this object will be used only after the last iteration.

        The same as readProperties() except that this is a generator that
        yields object (..analysis.Observations) holding requested data from all 
        observations (experiments) read so far and the object containing 
        data for the current observation.

        Note: Currently (r690) this method is not completely equivalent to
        readProperties(). When all subclasses of ..analysis.Groups are 
        modified to agree with this method, readProperties() should be 
        modified to be based on this method.

        If a property is not found, its value in the resulting Observations
        instance is set to None.

        If category is None all categories are used. Also, if identifier is
        None all identifiers for the cpecified category(ies) are used. 

        If more than one category is specified (argument category is None or
        a list) argument identifier should be None. Alternatively, if one
        category is specified, one or more (including all) identifiers can be
        specified

        In case multiple categories or identifiers are specified (as a list of
        strings) the order of yielded data will have the same order as
        the specified list.

        The argument properties is a list that holds attribute names of 
        objects containing data. If a property does not contain '.', its values
        (for all observations) are saved in this instance as an attribute of 
        the same name.

        In case a property name contain one or more '.'s (that is the property
        is an attribute of an attribute ...) the values of that property (for
        all observations) are saved in this instance as an attribute whose 
        name is derived from the property name and arg deep. If deep is '_',
        the '.'s in the property name are replaced by '_'s. Alternatively, if
        deep is 'last', the part aver the last '.' is used for the name of the
        corresponding attribute of this instance. Actually, arg deep can have 
        the same values as arg 'mode' of pyto.util.attributes.get_deep_name().

        attributes of multi. If it is None, a new instance of 
        pyto.analysis.Observations is created to hold these properties.

        If arg properties is a list, it has to contain a list of properties
        that are read. These properties are saved under property names derived 
        from arg properties (needs arg deep).

        If arg deep is '_', dots in name are replaced by underscores, and 
        if it is 'last', only the part after the rightmost dot is used as name.

        Alternatively, if arg properties is a dict, the keys are names of 
        properties that are read. The values are the names under which these
        properties are saved.

        Note: can be called only on objects of subclasses of MultiData that 
        implement getSingle() method.

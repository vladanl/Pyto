        Makes phantom consisting of two 3D rectangles, here called base
        and protrusion.

        A phantom is first created by placing the two rectangles according 
        to the specified size and (lower-left corner) positions. Then the 
        phantom is translated in x y and z so that the voxel at the position  
        specified by arg center is moved to the positions specified by
        arg origin.

        Initial rectangles have value 1. Values of the overlapping array 
        elements (pixels) in the resulting phantom are determined by arg 
        binary. It it is False, the rectangles are added (the overlap is 2) 
        and if it is True the overlap (like the rest of the rectangles) 
        gets value 1. The background is 0 in both cases.

        Arguments:
          - base_size, protrusion_size: (list or array of length 3) x, y 
          and z sizes of the base and protrusion rectangles 
          - base_pos, protrusion_pos: (list or array of length 3) x, y 
          and z positions of the minimal (lower-left) corner of the base 
          and protrusion rectangles 
          - shape: (list or array of length 3) shape of the phantom image
          - center: (list or array of length 3) special position on the 
          phantom
          - origin: (list or array of length 3) position to which the center 
          voxel is translated
          - binary: if True all elements of the phantom are set to 1, 
          otherwise overlapping elements are added

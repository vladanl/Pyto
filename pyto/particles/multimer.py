        Defines one or more multimers according to the specified 
        subunit composition. Subunits within a multimer are always ordered
        in the same way, by ascending subunit indices.

        Arg composition defines the numbers of monomers for one or more 
        multimer types and arg probability defines the probability of the 
        monomer types.

        For example:
          
          composition = ([3, 2, 1], [2, 2, 2])
          probability = (0.7, 0.3)

        probabilities 0.7 and 0.3. Both multimers contain three different
        monomer types and are composed of 6 monomers. The first multimer 
        contains 3 monomers of the first monomer type, 2 of the second and 
        1 of the third. The second multimer type contains 2 monomers of each

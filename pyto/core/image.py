class Image(object):
    """
    Methods for creating new images:
      - tile: tile current image to get a bigger one

    Input/output methods (see pyto.io.image_io for details):
      - read: reads data array from a file in em, mrc or raw-data format
      - write: writes data to a file

    Positioning of the image data array:

      - useInset(): main method to use, sets data to a specified inset
      - findEnclosingInset(inset): finds the smallest inset that fully 
      contain inset of this object and the inset specified by arg inset  
      - findIntersectingInset(inset): finds the intersection between the 
      inset of this object and the inset specified by arg inset
      - newFromInset(): makes new instance from this instance after data is
      set to the specified inset
      - inset: property defining current inset in respect tosome absolute
      reference
      - usePositioning() and copyPositioning(): based on useInset(), also
      takes property offset into account (depreciated)
      - saveFull(), recoverFull(), clearFull(): store, recall and clear
      another (previous, for example) inset and data array (properties
      fullInset and fullData)
      - fullInset, fullData: properties than can be set, but if there're
      not set they take the values from the deepest base of self.data
      (see getDeepBase())


    Example, speeding up calculations, memory not increased:

      new_data = self.useInset(inset=new_inset, update=False)

      (calculations using new_data)

    Alternative, the calculations can use the whole object:

      data, inset = self.getDataInset()   # keep reference to the original array
      self.useInset(inset=smaller_inset)

        (calculations using self)

      self.setDataInset(data=data, inset=inset) # self.data points to the
                                                # original array again

      Note: smaller_inset has to be smaller than self.inset. In this way
      calculations are done on a view of self.data (to increase speed) and
      self.data is never copied (so the memory is not increased).

    Example: memory use reduction

      new = self.newFromInset(inset=smaller_inset, copyData=True, deepcp=True)
      self = None     # so that self.data can be removed by garbage collection

        (calculations involving new)

      Again, small_inset has to be smaller than self.inset.


    Read and write examples for mrc files. In all cases header is preserved,
    except data type, shape and greyscale stats, which are determined
    from the image data:

    Using the same object, image data type stays the same, preserves header

      image = Image.read(input_path, header=True)
      image.data = ...  # manupulate image
      image.write(output_path, header=True, pixel=image.pixelsize)

    Changing datatype from float to int, preserves header

      image_in = pyto.grey.Image.read(input_path, header=True)
      image_out = pyto.segmentation.Labels()
      image_out.data = ... # manipulate image_in.data
      image_out.write(
          output_path, headerSource=image_in, pixel=image.pixelsize)

    Compact form

      ...  # define fun and fun_kwargs to modify image data 
      Image.modify(old=input_path, new=output_path, fun=..., fun_kwargs=...)

          - If the returned array is subsequently modified and the original
          data is used, returnCopy should be set to True.

        intersect is False, the behavior depends on useFull. If it's False an
        exception is raised. Otherwise self.data is set to the appropriate view
        of self.fullData.

        If the new inset is outside self.fullData, useFull is True and
        intersect is False, the behavior depends on expand. If it is False an
        exception is raised. Otherwise, a new data array is created that
        contains self.fullData and it is large enough to fit the new inset
        (elements outside self.fullData are set to arg value.

        Important: in the cases when self.fullData is used (the last two cases)
        self.data and self.fullData need to be consistent, that is self.data
        should be a view of self.fullData.

        Important: in case the data array is expanded and _fullInset and
        _fullData were set, properties fullInset and fullData might end up
        smaller than inset and data. To avoid that execute self.saveFull()
        after this method (removes old _fullInset and _fullData, but does not
        generate any additional array).

        Unless self.data is expanded (prevented by expand=False or
        intersect=True) no new array is formed in the memory, only the view
        of the array is changed.

        In all cases when a new array is created, changing self.data
        (if update is True) or the returned array (if update is False) does
        not change the original array.

        Can be used only on subclasses of this class that have data attribute.

          - inset: list of slice objects that defines the inset
          - mode: 'relative' (same as 'rel') or 'absolute' (same as 'abs')

          - expand: flag indicating if self.data array should be expanded if
          needed
          - value: used to fill the expanded part of self.data
          - update: flag indicating if the current object is updated, otherwise
          new data array is returned
          - returnCopy: flag indicating if in case update is False, the returned
          array is copied

        Sets (only if update is True):

        If arg header is True, file header (em, mrc or raw) is saved as
        attribute header. In any case attribute fileFormat is set.

        For mrc and em files, array order is determined from arg arrayOrder,
        from self.arrayOrder, or it is set to the default ("F") in
        this order. Data is read according the determined array order.
        That is, array order is not read from the file header.

        If arg memmap is True, instead into a nparray, the data is read to
        a memory map. That means that the complete data is not read into
        the memory, but the required parts are read on demand. This is useful
        when working with large images, but might not always work properly
        because the memory map is not quite properly a subclass of
        np.ndarray (from Np doc).

        Data from mrc files is always read as 3D because mrc header always
        contains lengths for all three dimensions (the length of the last
        dimeension is 1 for 2D images). In such cases one can obtain the
        2D ndarray using:

          self.data.reshape(self.data.shape[0:2])

        Sets attributes:
          - data: (ndarray) image data
          - pixelsize: (float or list of floats) pixel size in nm, 1 if pixel
          size not known
          - length: (list or ndarray) length in each dimension in nm
          - fileFormat: file format ('em', 'mrc', or 'raw')
          - memmap: from the argument
          - header: header (if arg header is True)

        Arguments:
          - file: file name
          - fileFormat: 'em', 'mrc', or 'raw'
          - byteOrder: '<' (little-endian), '>' (big-endian)
          - dataType: any of the numpy types, e.g.: 'int8', 'int16', 'int32',
            'float32', 'float64'
          - arrayOrder: 'C' (z-axis fastest), or 'F' (x-axis fastest)
          - shape: (x_dim, y_dim, z_dim)
          - header: flag indicating if file header is read and saved
          - memmap: Flag indicating if the data is read to a memory map,
          instead of reading it into a ndarray

        Writes image to a file in em, mrc or raw format.

        If fileFormat is not given it is determined from the file extension.

        Data (image) has to be specified by arg data or previously set
        self.data attribute.

        Data type and shape are determined by args dataType and shape,
        or by the data type and shape of the data, in this order..

        If data type (determined as described above) is not one of the
        data types used for the specified file format (ubyte, int16, float32,
        complex64 for mrc and uint8, uint16, int32, float32, float64,
        complex64 for em), then the value of arg dataType has to be one of the
        appropriate data types. Otherwise an exception is raised.

        If data type (determined as described above) is different from the
        type of actual data, the data is converted to the data type. Note that
        if these two types are incompatible according to arg casting, an
        exception is raised.

        The data is converted to the (prevously determined) shape and array
        order and then written. That means that the shape and the array order
        may be changed in the original array (argument data or self.data).
        However, array order is not written the header.

        Additional header parameters are determined for mrc format. Nxstart,
        nystart and nzstart are set to 0, while mx, my and mz to the
        corresponding data size (grid size). xlen, ylen and zlen are taken from
        arg length if given, or obtained by multiplying data size with pixel
        size (in nm).

        If arg header is True and if the file type corresponding to arg file
        is the same as self.fileFormat, a header consisting of self.header
        (list) and self.extendedHeaderString (str) are written as file
        header. The extended header should be used only for mrc format.

        If arg headerSource is specified, attributes headerSource.header and 
         headerSource.extndedHeaderString are used to make the image
        header written by this method, except that image data type, shape 
        and stats are determined from image data. Overrides arg header.

        If specified, args fileFormat, byteOrder, dataType, arrayOrder,
        shape, length and pixel have precedence.

        Arguments:
          - file: file name

          - shape: (x_dim, y_dim, z_dim)
          - length: (list aor ndarray) length in each dimension in nm (used
          only for mrc format)
          - pixel: (default 1) pixel size in nm (used only for mrc format 
          if length is None)
          - casting: Controls what kind of data casting may occur: 'no',
          'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'. Identical to np.astype()
          method.

        Binns this image (any number of dimensiions) and possibly applies

        Binning function (arg fun) has to take a ndarray and axis as arguments.
        For example nd.mean, nd.mean, nm.max, ... .

        Arg remain determines behavior when image shape is not divisible by 
        (arg) factor as follows:

        Using the Gaussian filter and sigma=2 completely removes the

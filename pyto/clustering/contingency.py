        Matches clusters with reference classes.
        
        First, associates each cluster with the reference class that most 
        of the cluster elements belongs to (saved as attribute class_ref).
        Then, joins the clusters associated with the same reference classes
        to form matched clusters. In this way, 1 to 1 corespondence 
        between the matched clusters and reference classes. Note that not 
        all clusters need to have an associated reference class.

        The matched contingency matrix (self.matched) is created from the 
        existing contingency matrix (self.data) by modifying the latter
        to reflect the above associations. The columns are ordered so that 
        the matched contingency matrix is diagonalized. The rows of the 
        resulting matrix correspond to the matched clusters and columns to 
        reference classes (attribute match). In case a cluster is not 
        associated with any reference class, the corresponding rows are 
        filled with 0's. 

        All together, the matched contingency matrix has a square shape
        (the size equals the number of reference classes), the 
        columns denote reference classes and the rows the matched clusters, 
        and the matched clusters are associated with the reference classes
        of the same index.

        Note: Useful when reference classes have the same number of elements.
        Otherwise, not clear how to use it.

        Calculates several properties used to evaluate the clustering.

        First checks wheteher the clusters and reference classes were matched
        (that is whether self.matched exists, (see self.match()), or 
        executes self.match() if atg match is True. If not, self data is 
        taken to be the matched contingency matrix.

        Marginal values of both contingency and the matched contingency 
        matrices are calculated.

        The number of true positives is calculated for the original 
        (from contingency matrix) and matched clusters (from the 
        matched contingency matrix). False positives and false
        negatives are calculated for the matched clusters.

        Precision and recall are defined in the following way:

          precision = (1 / N_ref_classes) * TP / (TP + FP) 
          recall = (1 / N_ref_classes) * TP / (TP + FN)
          recall_adj = (1 / N_clusters) * TP / (TP + FN)

        The adjusted recall (recall_adj) shows improved behavior because 
        it decreases with the increasing number of clusters.

        F1 measure is calculated using both recalls (see 
        bioRxiv doi:10.1101/413484 ):

        F1 = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

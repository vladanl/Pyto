"""
Functions to make random point patterns.

Currently, the most important usage of this module is to generate a 
(int coordinate) random point pattern on an arbitrary region with 
imposing a minimal (exclusion) distance between points:

  random_region(N=N_points, region=region_image, region_id=region_label_id,
                exclusion=exclusion_distance)

Instead by a region image, a region can be specified by an array of 
(int) coordinates that comprise the region:

  random_region(N=N_points, region_coords=region_coordinates,
                exclusion=exclusion_distance)

The central function of this module is:
   pattern_exclusion()
which calls a no exclusion pattern generating function as many times as
needed to generate the specified number of points while imposing exclusion.  

To make another point pattern with exclusion, the simplest way is to:
  - define a function that generates the desired point pattern without 
  exclusion
  - define a function that passes the above function to pattern_exclusion(),
  which performs exclusion on the patter produced by the above function

    If it is not possible to generate points as specified (by N, exclusion,

    In more detail, it iteratively generates n_factor * N points 
    and removes points closer to the minimal exclusion distance as long as it 
    is needed to reach N points. At each iteration, it removes newly generated
    points that are closer than the exclusion distance to the previously
    accepted points, and removes points of the newly generated set that 
    are closer to each other than the exclusion distance.

    Two methods are implemented to exclude poins within a newly generated set 
    (the second of the tasks mentioned above):
      - rough (mode='rough'): When two points are closer than the exclusion 
      distance, it keeps the first and removes the second point. This is 
      simple and fast but the efficiency is not optimal. Namely, when the
      distances beteween points 1 and 2, and between points 2 and 3,
      but not between points 1 and 3 are shorter than the exclusion, points
      2 and 3 will be excluded although 3 should be retained. 
      - fine (mode='fine'): After doing the rough exclusion it recursively 
      cleans the excluded particles to find those that could be retained.
    Therefore, the rough method uses a simple exclusion proocedure that may 
    unnecessarily exclude some points and thus generates more random points,
    while the fine method does precise exclsion (which takes longer time)
    but overall generates a lower number of particles. Importantly, both 
    methods generate random points that obey the exclusion.

    The projection can be done in two ways:
      - project_mode='closest': Points are projected to their closest
      region points
      - project_mode='line': Points are projected along a specified line
      and the projection points are obtained as the line - region
      intersection point that is the closest to the points.

    See the docs in pyto.spatial.LineProjection, including project()
    and __init__() for more info about the 'line' mode.

    In line 'line' mode, region coordinates are expected to be passed
    to this function as args region_coords, or region and region_id.
    The analogous attributes of (arg) line_projection object are ignored,
    contrary to the usage of LineProjection alone.

    Args line_projection, line_project_angles and line_project_distance
    are used only in 'line' projection mode. The meaning of arg angles
    and the way line projection is performed is determined by the 
    attributes of line_projection object. The line projection object has 
    to have attribute intersect_mode set to 'first'.

    If in the line mode a projection is not found, coordinates specified
    by arg not_found are entered. This should be something like
    [-1, -1, -1] (default).

    Arguments:
      - points: (ndarray n_points x 3) coordinates of points from which
      the line projection is made
      - region_coords: (ndarray n_region_points x 3) coordinates of all

      - project_mode: projection mode, 'closest' or 'line'
      - line_projection: (pyto.spatial.LineProjection) contains 
      line projection parameters
      - line_project_angles: 3 Euler angles, or just relion tilt and
      psi angles as specified in relion refinement star files

      distance(s) [pixel], all of these are used for each point.

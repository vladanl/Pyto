        Makes a N-dimensional parallelogram in the N-dim space (N>1) and
        returns the corresponding instance of this class. The image 
        containing this parallelogram is saved as attribute data 
        (N-dimensional ndarray).

        The parallelogram is defined by origin and basis vectors where:
          - origin (1D array of length N) contains coordinates of
          one corner
          - basis vectors (2D array NxN, axis 0 represents points and
          axis 1 dimensions) are coordinates of the N corners that are
          connected to the origin by one edge of the rectangle.

        Origin and basis vectors are determined by the first
        criterion from the following that matches:
          - If arg corners is specified, it has to be N+1 x N array,
          where corners[0, :] are coordinates of the origin and
          corners[1:,:] are coordinates of the basis vectors
          - If args corners and origin are specified, these two are used

        In the image containing the parallelogram, the surface of the
        parallelogram is labeled by 0, the interior by -1 and exterior
        by 1. The surface thickness is specified by arg thick.

        Specifically, the parallelogram is constructed using N-1 dim
        planes defined by the origin and all except one of the basis
        vectors (so N planes), and then a parallel plane that contains
        the omitted basis is constructed for each of the (initial) planes
        (see also Plane.make()).

        Arguments:
          - shape (1D array of len N): shape of the resulting image
          - corners (N+1 x N array) that specifies coordinates of the
          origin (corners[0,:] and N basis vectors (corners[1:,:])
          - origin (1D array of len N): coordinates of the origin corner
          - basis (NxN array, axis 0 denotes points): coordinates of
          basis corners (vectors)
          - thick: thickness of N-1 dim planes forming the surface of
          the parallelogram (+/- thick/2 from the exact plane)

    Manipulations and analysis of segmented images (label fields).

    All segments are expected to be spatially separated, that is they should
    not touch each other.

    Important instance attributes:
      - data (ndarray): segmented image data. Read-only, use setData() to
      write new data.
      - ids (ndarray): all ids. Read-only, use setIds method to set new ids.
      - offset: offset of data in respect to the inputData used to make
      segments (depreciated)
      - boundaryIds: list of all boundaries (boundary ids) (remove?)
      - freeIds: list of all free region ids
      - _free: dictionary where each key is a list of boundaries
      used to make a free region and a corresponding value is the free
      region id
      - structEl: instance of StructEl, structuring element used for the
      connectivity of segments
      - contactStructEl: SE used to find segement - boundary contacts

        """
        Makes a free region between segments of this instance. 

        The free region can be formed where mask > 0 only. The main idea behind
        mask is to set it so that the existing boundaries are off-limits to
        the formation of free regions. If mask is a Label it's positioning
        (inset) is adjusted and it may be expanded to match self.data. 
        If mask is a ndarray it is applied to self.data directly. Finally, 
        if mask is an int, or a list of ints the free region is formed 
        where self.data equals any of the values of mask.

        If mode is 'add' and size is an int, finds all elements of self.data
        whose Euclidean distance to a nearest boundary defined by ids is
        smaller or equal to size (the fastest variant, calls
        ndimage.distance_transform_edt once). If size is an array,
        all elements of self.data whose Euclidian distance to any of the
        boundaries is smaller or equal to the corresponding size (calls
        ndimage.distance_transform_edt once for each id). In both cases
        the selected elements of self.data form a free region.

        If mode is 'intersect', the free region is obtained by the intersection
        of regions (of self.data) surrounding each boundary (given by ids).
        Each element of these surrounding regions can have at most size (for
        the corresponding id) Euclidean distance to the boundary (calls
        ndimage.distance_transform_edt once for each id). 

        If size is a single number <= 0, the free region is formed based on
        mask only.

        If update is True, adds the free region to self.data, and puts the id
        of the free region to self.freeIds, make a corresponding entry in
        self._free and returns the id or the free region. If update is false
        returns a Labels object that contains the free region, and has the same
        positioning attributes (offset, inset) as this instance.

        Note: does not make an entry in self._free, because not sure if 
        that's needed for anything.

        Arguments:
          - ids: list of boundaryIds, or a single int
          - size: list (or ndarray) of maximum distances to each boundary. If
          single number then it's used for all boundaries. If it is <= 0 free
          region is obtained from mask only.
          - mask: (ndarray, int, list or Label) Positive elements of mask 
          define a region where a free region is allowed to be created.
          Alternatively, if mask is an int (list of ints), then the free
          region can be formed where elements of self.data equal (any of the
          ids from) the mask.
          - mode: 'intersect' or 'add' determines how the new region is
          formed
          - update: flag that determines if a free region is added to this
          instance.

        Returns: Labels object whose data attribute is a ndarray (of the same 
        shape and position as self.data) defining the free region.

        """
        Makes layers between boundaries labeled by bound_1 and bound_2 and 
        calculates the width between boundaries.

        The layers are made on a region specified by mask (layers region). If 
        mask is an int (or a list of int's) it denotes id(s) of segment(s) of 
        this instance that make a mask. Alternatively, if it is a ndarray 
        positive elements definem the region where layers are made.

        If arg maxDistance is specified, the mask is adjusted so that the
        elements that have sum of distances to both boundaries larger than
        maxDistance are discarded.

        If fill is True, holes in the mask that were created by adjusting 
        the maxDistance (see paragraph above) are filled. In order to detect
        holes both layer region and boundaries are taken into account, and
        the default structuring element (see scipy.ndimage.binary_fill_holes)
        is used. 

        If the arument width is None, first the distance between boundaries is 
        calculated as the mean/min/max/median (see arg between) value of the 
        distance from each element of boundary 2 that touches the adjusted mask 
        region to boundary 1. Then the width is calculated as the distance 
        between boundaries minus 1. Note: Cleft.getWidth() uses a bit nicer way
        to calculate this distance.

        Array elements are assigned to layers based on their eucliden distances
        to (the closest element of) both segments bound_1 and bound_2. In total 
        nLayers are made between the boundaries. If nLayers is not given it is 
        set to the rounded (int) value of the width.

        In case nExtraLayers is 0, layers are numbered from 1 (closest to
        bound_1) to nLayers (closest to bound_2). Numerical parameter offset
        determines the distribution of layers. It should be larger than 0 and
        smaller than 1. The bigger this parameter the more elements are
        included in the outside layers. The formula used to calculate the
        layer position is:

        layer_no = floor{(d_1-offset) * nLayers / (d_1+d_2-2*offset) + 1}

        where d_1 and d_2 are the shortest distances to segments bound_1 and 
        bound_2. 

        In case nExtraLayers is > 0, extra layers are formed in addition to the
        layers between the boundaries (explained above). The extra layers are 
        formed on the boundaries and the extra regions (args extra_1 and 
        extra_2). The extra layers are formed based on their euclidean distance 
        to the closest 'between' layer, and they have the same thickness as the 
        'between' layers. This is done using self.makeLayersFrom() method. 
        The additional layers over the first boundary and the first extra 
        region are numbered from 1 to nExtraLayers, the ids of the 'between' 
        layers are shifted by nExtraLayers and the layers over the second 
        boundary and the second extra region go from nLayers_nExtraLayers+1 
        to nLayers+2*nExtraLayers.

        Arguments:
          - bound_1, bound_2: (int, list or ndarray) id(s) of boundaries
          list of ints
          - mask: (ndarray, int or a list of int's) region where layers are
          formed
          - nLayers: number of layers between the boundaries
          - width: distance between boundaries
          - between: denotes how the distance between segments is calculated. It
          can 'mean', 'min', 'max', median', the same as the mode argument in

        """
        Makes layers starting from a boundary (one or more segments specified 
        by argument bound) on a region specified by arg mask and returns them 
        as an object of this class.

        Array elements are assigned to layers based on their euclidean distance 
        to (the closest element) of segment bound. The thickness of each layer 
        is given by argument thick. In total nLayers are made.
        
        Layers are numbered from 1 (closest to bound) to nLayers. Numerical
        parameter offset determines the distribution of layers. It should
        be larger than 0 and smaller than 1. The bigger this parameter the more
        elements are included in the first layer. The formula used to calculate
        the layer position is:

        layer_no = rint{(d - offset) / thick + offset} + 1

        where d is the shortest distance to segment bound. For example, if 
        thick = 1 the layer assignment for different distances are:

                       layer 1  layer 2  layer 3  ...
          offset=0       1-2      2-3      3-4
          offset=0.5   0.5-1.5  1.5-2.5  2.5-3.5

        The layers are made on a region specified by mask. If mask is an int (or
        a list of int's) it denotes id(s) of segment(s) of this instance that 
        make a mask. Alternatively, if it is a ndarray positive elements define 
        the region where layers are made.

        In case nExtraLayers is > 0, extra layers are formed on the boundary 
        and the extra region (arg extra). The extra layers are formed based on 
        their euclidean distance to the closest 'normal' layer, with the same
        thickness. The extra layers are numbered from 1 to nExtraLayers, while
        the ids of the 'normal' layers are shifted by nExtraLayers.

        Arguments:
          - bound: (int, list or ndarray) segment id(s) or the boundary used 
          to start making layers
          - thick: thickness of each layer
          - mask: (ndarray, int or a list of int's) region where layers are
          formed
          - nLayers: number of layers
          - nExtraLayers: number of additional layers
          - extra_1: (int, list or ndarray of int's) id(s) of the extra region
          - offset: numerical parameter that compensates for the discrete 
          positions in an array and so determins the exact position of layers,
          has to be 0 - 1, default 0.5 makes the positions symmetrical

        Returns (Segment) instance containing layers. The data array of the 
        returned instance might have smaller shape than self.data (reduced to
        use less memory), but the inset attribute is set to define the position
        of the returned data.

class Contact(object):
    """
    Analysis of contacts between segments and boundaries.

    Important methods:
      - findContacts: detects and optionally counts contacts between
      segments and boundaries (needs to be run before the methods given below)
      - findSegments: finds segments that satisfy given condition (such as
      number of contacted boundaries) among all contacts previously detected
      by findContacts
      - findBoundaries: finds boundaries that satisfy given condition (such as
      number of contacted segments) among all contacts previously detected
      by findContacts

    The following example finds all contancts between segments 2,3,5 and 7
    with boundaries 1,3,4 and 6, and then returns ids of segments that
    contact both boundary 1 and 4 but do not contact any other boundary:

      con = Contact()  # instantiation
      con.findContacts(segment=seg, segmentIds=[2,3,5,7], boundary=bound,
                       boundaryIds=[1,3,4,6])
      con.findSegments(boundaryIds=[1,4], mode='exact')

    Important instance attributes:
      - labels: Connected object containing an image of contacts labeled
      by segment ids
      - segment: (ndarray) segmented image containing segments
      - segmentIds: ids of segments
      - boundary: (ndarray) segmented image containing boundaries
      - boundaryIds: ids of boundaries
      - contactStructEl: structure element used for finding contacts between
      boundaries and structures
      - countStructEl: structure element used to distinguish and count
      conntacts between a given segment and a given region.

    Internal structures (should not be manipulated directly):
      - _n: contact data structure currently implemented as a masked array
      where _n[boundId, segId] is a number of contacts segment segId makes
      with boundary boundId. Shape = (nBoundaries+1, nSegments+1), so that
      boundary (segment) i as accessed as _n[i,:] (_n[;,i]). Data with
      index 0 (any) are not used.

        Each of the above conditions is modified by mode. Mode='exact' means

          nSegment of the segments specified as elements of  segmentIds are
          selected.

          4) If both segmentIds and nSegment are None, all boundary ids
          are returned.
    
        Each of the above conditions is modeified by mode. Mode='exact' means
        that the boundaries whose ids are returned satisfy the condition 
        exactly. That is, these boundaries contact all segments in segmentIds 
        and no other segment, or exactly nSegment segments. In mode='at_least'
        ('at_most') all the boundaries contact at least (at most) all segments
        with segmentIds but may contact other segments also, or the boundaries
        contact nSegment or more segments.

        Example:

          findBoundaries(segmentIds=[1,3,6], nSegment=2, mode='exact')

        returns ids of boundaries that contact only two of the segments 1,3 or 6
        and do not contact any other segment.

        Furthemore, segmentIds can be a nested list. In that case, segment ids
        that are given in a sub-list are taken in the 'or' sense, as if those
        segments were merged together. 
    
        Another example:

          findBoundaries(segmentIds=[[1,2],4], nSegment=2, mode='exact')

        returns ids of boundaries that contact segment 4 and any (or both) of
        1 and 2 and none of the other segments.

        If update=True the other boundaries are removed from the contacts data
        structure.

        Arguments:
          - segmentIds: list of segment ids that are checked for contact
          with boundaries. Can be given as int if only one id.
          - nSegment: (int) number of contacted segments
          - mode: 'exact' (or 'eq'), 'at_least' (or 'ge'), or 'at_most' 
          (or 'le')
          - update: flag indicating if the contact data structure is updated

        Returns: ndarray of boundaries that satisfy the condition.

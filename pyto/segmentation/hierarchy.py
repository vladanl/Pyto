    """
    A hierarchy contains segments that are orgainuzed in a strictly hierarchical
    manner, that is they satisfy the following requirements:
      1) Each segment is either superset (overlaps), subset or does not
      intersect any other segment. 
      2) Segments are organized in levels, all segments of a level taken
      together overlap all segmenents at one level below the level.   
    
    Adding and removing hierarchy levels:
      - addLevel: adds given segments to a specified level
      - extractLevelsGen: generator that yields levels
      - popLevel: removes top or bottom level and returns it 
      - extractLevel: returns specified level
      - removeLowerLevels: removes ids corresponding to all levels below a
      given level
      - removeHigherLevels: removes ids corresponding to all levels above a
      given level
      - remove: removes segments corresponding to the given ids

    Lower level id related methods:
      - getIdLevels: returns levels of specified ids
      - findHigherIds: finds ids directly above given ids 
      - findLowerIds: finds ids directly below given ids

    Analysis:
      - 
    
    Conversion:
      - toSegment(): converts this instance to Segment provided this instance
      is flat (no segment is above or below any other segment)

    Data structure attributes (should not be accessed directly):
      - self.ids: (numpy.ndarray) all ids
      eg: [2,4,5,6,12,16,19,22, ...]
      - self.levelIds: each element of this list is alist that contains all
      ids present at that level
      eg: [[2,4,5,6], [12,16,19], [22], ...]
      - self._higherIds: distionary of one level higher ids for each id
      eg: {2:12, 4:16, 5:16, 6:16, 12;22, 16:22, 22:None, ...} 
      - self._lowerIds: dictionary of (lists of) one level lower ids for each id
      inverse of self._higherIds)
      eg: {2:[], 3:[], 5:[], 12:[2], 16:[4,5,6], 19:[], 22:[12,16], ...}
      - self.data: ndarray of all segments

    There might be a number of level-defined properties, whose names are given
    in self.properties.

    def addLevel(self, segment, level=None, check=False, shift=None, props={}):
        """
        Inserts segment at the given level or at the appropriate level. Current
        levels higher or equal to level are pushed up.

        All id and data structures are updated to include added segments. 
        Respects positioning (attribute inset) of both this object and arg
        segment. Inset (data) of this object is enlarged to be able to
        fit the data af segment.

        The ids of segment are increased by shift before segment is added 
        to self.data. If shift is None the ids are increased by self.maxId,
        so that the added segments do not overlap with the current ones. If
        there's no data (self.maxId is 0) shift is set to 0.

        Modifies segment in the following ways. Removes all segments from 
        segment.data that are not listed in segment.ids. After that, shifts
        segment ids (both in segment.data and segment.ids) so that the shifted
        ids do not colide with the ids of this instance. Also, may change 
        positioning of segment so that it aligns with this object, 

        Adds 'shift' to self.properties and sets self.shift[level] to the
        current shift. Also adds other properties given in (arg) props
        using self.addProperties.

        Important: check can be used only if this instance forms a perfect
        herarchy, that is all segments are below the highest segment.

        Arguments:
          - segment: (instance of Segment) segments to be added

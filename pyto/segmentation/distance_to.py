    """
    Distance from segments to specified region(s)

    Important attributes:

      - distance: distance for each segment
      - closestRegion: id of the closest region, for each segment

    Basic usage:

      # caclulate
      dist = DistanceTo(segments=segment_object)
      dist.getDistance(regionIds, regions)
    
      # show results
      dist.distance

    Note: unlike other classes that inherit from Features, the data of this
    class is internally storred in a compact form. That is, elements of 
    self.ids and self._distance directly correspond to each other, both arrays
    are compact. On the other hand, self.distance is dynamically generated 
    (from self._distance) and is indexed by ids (self.distance[i] is the 
    distance for the i-th segment). Important consequence is that changing 
    self.ids effectively changes data (self.distance). The same is true for 
    self.closestRegion and self._closestRegion.

        Calculates distance of each segment to its closest region.

        Regions are specified by (Image or ndarray) region and regionIds. If 
        (arg) region is not specifed this instance is used. If regionIds is not
        given, the region is defined as all positive elements of region array.

        Takes into account positioning of segments and regions.

        If surfaces > 0, only the surfaces (of thickness given by arg surface)
        of the segments are considered. Otherwise whole segments are taken into 
        account. In any case the full region is used.

        If mode is 'center', shortest distances between the region and segment
        centers (note that center may lay outside the segment) are calculated.

        If mode is 'min'/'max'/'mean'/'median', the shortest distance between
        each (surface, if arg surface is not None) element of segments and the
        region are calculated first, and then the min/max/mean/median of these
        values is found for each segment separately. Finally, the closest
        region for each segment is found. 

        If more than one region id is given (arg regionIds is a list with 
        >1 element) the distance between a segment and each region is 
        calculated first (according to the arg mode) and then the closest
        region is found. Note that in case of mean / median mode this means
        that the mean / median is calculated to one (closest) region.

        If ids are not given, distances to all segments are calculated. 

        If the distance to a segment can not be calculated (if the segments does
        not exist, for example) the result for that segment is set to -1.

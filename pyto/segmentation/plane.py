Class Plane provides methods for crating and manipulating n-1 dimensional planes
in n dimentional space, in addition to methods defined in its base class 
Segment.

Notes: 
  - Currently only used in ball.py (3.2021)
  - Plan to implement a similar one in geometry/plane.py

        """
        Generator yielding (ndarray) planes defined by normal vectors
        (vectors) and points that belong to the arrays (points), as well as the
        subspaces on the positive and negative sides of the planes.

        Each output array has the shape and position defined by the corresponding
        element of slices. Points are given in respect to the same coordinate
        system that is used to define slices.

        Output array elements that belong to a plane are set to 0, while those
        that do not are labeled by 1 (on the positive side on the plane according
        to the direction of the corresponding normal vector) or by -1 (on the
        negative side).
        
        An element of an output array is considered to belong to a plane if its
        Euclidean distance to the plane is <= thick/2, so that thick is the
        "thickness" of each plane. If thick=0, only the array elements whose
        distance to the plane is 0 exactly are labeled by 0.

        Points and slices have to have the same number of elements. If only one
        vector is given it is used for all points/slices.

        Arguments:
          - vectors: normal vectors (or just one vector) needed to define a
          plane (shape n_planes, ndim, or ndim)
          - points: (coordinates of) points that belong to planes (shape
          n_planes, ndim), given in respect to the same coordinate system
          used for slices
          - slices: slices that define the size and position of each output
          array (shape n_planes, ndim)

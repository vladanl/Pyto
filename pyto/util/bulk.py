def replace(old, rules, new=None, repeat=None):
    """
    Writes a new file where lines of the old file are modified according
    to the arg rules. 

    Each line is modified by all rules that apply. The order of the rule
    application is not specified, the order is actually given by rules.items().

    A line that matches arg repeat is first copied and then (the second copy
    of the line is) modified according to the rules. 

    If new is None, the (old) file is replaced by the modified one. In that 
    case arg old can only be a (string) file name. Alternatively, if old and 
    new are the same file names the modified file will replace the old one.

      - old, new: old and new files, either file name strings or open file 
      descriptors

def run_path(path, package=''):
    """
    Run one or more python files (modules).  

    Each module is executed from the directory where it resides, and the 
    current directory is afterwards reverted to the original one. 

    In the current version modules are first imported under unique names,
    which is useful when module files have the same names (but reside in 
    different directories).

    In Python <= 2.6 each file module need to be loaded. Its full module
    name is

      package + '.' + file_name + '_' + _module_index

    where arg package is an already existing package name and a current 
    value of variable _module_index. This variable starts at 0 and is increased
    after each module import.

    In Python >= 2.7 this should change so that modules do not need to be
    imported at all, but this isn't implemented yet.

      - path: (str or iterable) module path(s)

    Formation and analysis of cleft regions. A cleft is defined by a 
    greyscale image (self.image) and a corresponding segmentation (self.cleft) 
    that defines two boundaries and cleft proper that is located between the 
    boundaries (self.cleft). 

    Cleft regions are segments organized as layers parallel to
    the boundaries or columns perpendicular to the boundaries .

    Contains methods for the geometrical analysis of the cleft and for the 
    basic statistical analysis of cleft regions density. 

    Important attributes:
      - self.regions: (..segmentation.Segment) cleft regions
      - self.image: density (greyscale) image
      - self.cleft (..segmentation.Cleft): labels main cleft parts (boundaries,
      cleft proper)
      - self.nLayers: number of layers (layers)
      - self.nBoundLayers: number of boundary layers (layers)

    Common usage to make layers / columns:
    
      cl = CleftRegions(image=image, cleft=cleft)
      cl.makeLayers() / cl.makeColumns()
      cl.findDensity(regions=cl.regions)

    Some of the attributes calculated and set by this example are:
      - self.regions: (..segmentation.Segment) regions
      - self.regionDensity (pyto.segmentation.Density) region density
      - self.width: cleft width (layers)
      - self.widthVector: average cleft width vector (layers)

    All methods respect image inset information.

        """
        Makes layers on the cleft and possibly on the boundary regions of a 
        cleft (self.cleft) and calculates cleft width.

        Width (magnitude and vector) is calculated using
        pyto.segmentation.Cleft.getWidth() method, according to arg widthMode
        (passed as arg mode), and by combining cleft distances from both 
        boundaries (Cleft.getWidth() argument toBoundary=0). 

        Layers are formed using pyto.segmentation.Cleft.makeLayers() method.
        In short, layers of the same thickness are first made on the cleft
        region based on the euclidean distance to the cleft boundaries (cleft 
        layers). Cleft layers are restricted to those elements of the cleft 
        region that are not further away from the boundaries than arg 
        maxDistance. If arg fill is True, the holes in the cleft region that 
        are formed by the maxDistance procedure are filled. Then, if arg 
        nBoundLayers > 0, additional layers are formed on cleft boundaries 
        based on the euclidean distance to the cleft layers (boundary layers).

        If arg nLayers is None, the number of cleft layers is calculated as 
        the rounded value of cleft width, so that layers are approximately 1 
        pixel size wide. 

        If arg adjust is True, the cleft and boundary regions (of self.cleft)
        are restricted to include only those elements that were assigned to
        cleft and boundary layers. If in additon arg refine is specified,
        cleft width is recalculated using the adjusted cleft and boundary 
        regions. In case arg nLayers is None and the recalculated cleft width 
        leads to a different number of cleft layers, the layers are
        recalculated also.

        Arguments:
          - widthMode: cleft width calculating mode, 'mean', 'median', 'min' or 
          'max' (actually can be any appropriate numpy function)
          - nLayers: number of layers
          - maxDistance: max allowed sum of (minimal) distances to the two 
          bounaries, if None no limit is imposed
          - fill: flag indicating if holes created by maxDistance procedure
          are filled (used only if maxDistance is not None)
          - nBoundLayers: (int) number of additional layers formed on each side

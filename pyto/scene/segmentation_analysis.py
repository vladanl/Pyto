        Segment using thresholding and connectivity and analyze segments.

        Segmentation and analysis parameters need to be set in advance (see
        setSegmentationParameters() and setAnalysisParameters()).

        Makes threshold and connectivity segmentations at each level,  
        analyzes the segments and yields the segmentation. After the 
        segmentation is done at all required levels, yields a (complete) 
        hierarchical segmentation.

        The (complete) analysis results are saved as attributes of this object
        that may include (these attributes are listed in self.resultNames):
          - self.density: (Density) density stats for all segments
          - self.regionDensity: (Density, non-array form) density stats for
          the segmentation region
          - self.morphology: (Morphology) morphology for all segments, includes
          length at self.morphology.length
          - self.topology: (Topology) topology for all segments
          - self.distance: (DistanceTo) distance to a specified region. The 
          name of this attribute can be different if it's specified as
          argument distanceName of setAnalysisParameter(). Also, there can be
          more than one distance if the distanceName argument is a list of
          names.
          - self.boundDistance: (boundDistance) distances between the boundries 
          contacting segments (for segments with exactly two boundaries)
          - self.nContacts, self.surfaceDensityContacts, 
          self.surfaceDensitySegments: (ndarrays of length 3), the array 
          elements correspond to both boundaries together, boundary 1 and 
          boundary 2. Meant for cleft-like segmentation regions.
 
        Note: if doLength is True, doMorphology is effectivly set to True also.

        Yields a new instance of this class at each threshold, that contains 
        the analysis results for the current level only and backgroundDensity
        attribut. In addition, the yielded instance also has several 
        segmentation parameters (lengthContact, lengthLine, nBoundary, 
        boundCount, structElConn, contactStructElConn, countStructElConn, 
        distanceId and distanceMode).

        After the segmentation is completed, yields the hierarchical 
        segmentation. This instance has all analysis results as attributes 
        whose names are listed in self.resultNames.

        Analysis results for an individual level can also be read at the time
        the segmentation for that level is yielded, from attributes 
        that have the same names (as the complete analysis result attributes)
        but with a preceeding underscore (self._density, self._morphology, ...).
        Furthermore the basic density stats for background is in 
        self._backgroundDensity (Density, non-array form).

        Arguments:
          - thresh: all thresholds (saved as self.thresholds)
          - order: threshold order: '>' or 'descend' for descending, '<' or 
          'ascend' for ascending, None to keep the order of thresh 
          - image: (Image) image
          - boundary: (Segment) boundaries
          - do*: flags indicating if particular analysis should be done

        Yields at each level: new_inst, level, threshold
          - new_instance: new instance of this class containing:
            - segments: the current (flat) segmentation (by reference, that 
            is not copied)
            - all analysis results at the current level (deepcopied) 
          - level: current level (valid for the final segmentation only if
          arg thresholds are in ascending order)
          - threshold: current threshold

        Yields, after segmentation is finished for all levels: 
          - tc: (ThreshConn) containing:
            - hierarchy: hierarchical segmentation
            - analysis of all segments

        Classifies and analyzes a hierarchical segmentation specified by arg
        hierarchy. For each class generated, yields an instance of this class
        that contains a subset of the original hierarchical segmentation 
        (a class of segments) and analysis results for that class.

        One or more classifications are defined by arg self.classifications 
        (set by addClassificationParameters()). Preforms classifications in 
        the order they appear in self.classifications. The classifications are
        done recursively.

        Each class generated according to one classification is then classified 
        according to the next one. In order to minimize memory usage classes
        are generated on demand. This means that after the first class of the 
        first classification is generated, this class is then classified 
        according to the second classification (before the second class of the
        first classification is generated) and so on. Consequently, the 
        classes generated by the last classification 'change' the fastest.

        For example, if classification 1 generates classes a and b, and 
        classification 2 p, q and r, the classes are generated in the order:
        ap, aq, ar, bp, bq, br.

        May modify arg hierarchy. See methods preforming individual
        classifications (keepSegments, classByVolume, classByContactedIds,
        classByNContacted) for details.

        Depending on the arguments, may perform analysis of (grey-scale) 
        density, morphology, topology, distance to region and boundary 
        distance. See the attributes of the yielded object and the docs for the 
        analysis methods.

        If the current instance already contains analysis results and the 
        analysis flags (args do*) are False, the results are retained in the 
        classes but restricted to the segments (ids) that exist in that class.

        Note that even if the current instance already contains nContacted 
        and surfaceDensity*, they are recalculated. In this case arg 
        doCleftContacts doesn't matter, because it is internaly set to True.

        Alternatively, if the analysis flags are True, the analysis is 
        preformed only for segments existing in the classes, and the analysis
        results of the current instance are not used.

        Note: if doLength is True, doMorphology is effectivly set to True also.

    def classify(self, hierarchy, classifications=None, name=''):
        """
        Generator for classification of segments from a hierarchical
        segmentation. 

        Reads classification parameters for classifications defined in arg or
        self.classifications (set by addClassificationParameters()). Preforms
        classifications in the order they appear in (self.)classifications.
        The classifications are done recursively.

        Classifications are given by a list where each element is a dict that 
        defines one classification. Each dictionary needs to have in item with 
        name 'type', which determines the method used for classification. 
        Currently, the names: 'keep', 'volume', 'connected_ids' or 
        'n_contacted' specify classification methods keepSegments(),
        classByVolume(), classByContactedIds() and classByNContacted(), 
        respectively. All other items of a classification dictionary are passed
        as (dict) arguments to the corresponding classification method. See
        the docs for the individual classification methods for their
        arguments.

        Each class generated according to one classification is then classified 
        according to the next one. In order to minimize memory usage classes
        are generated on demand. Tha means that after the first class of the 
        first classification is generated, this class is then classified 
        according to the second classification (before the second class of the
        first classification is generated) and so on. Consequently, the 
        classes generated by the last classification 'change' the fastest.

        For example, if classification 1 generates classes a and b, and 
        classification 2 p, q and r, the classes are generated in the order:
        ap, aq, ar, bp, bq, br.

        May modify arg hierarchy. See methods preforming individual
        classifications (keepSegments, classByVolume, classByContactedIds,
        classByNContacted) for details.

        Arguments:
          - hierarchy: (Hierarchy) hierarchy of segments
